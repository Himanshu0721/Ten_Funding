        companyoverview: "Angel Fund is a non-profit founded by myself and the Samaha family in memory of Reema Samaha, one of the 32 killed at Virginia Tech on April 16, 2007. Its mission is to create a safe environment for young people to feel respected and self-confident and to show tolerance towards others. We believe that our vision of a community that takes action against bullying, addiction, depression and suicide will be realized because young people have the power to touch the lives of others and to make a difference.",
