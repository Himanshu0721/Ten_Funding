Driven by our passion for entrepreneurship, we set out on a mission to solve this problem. We embarked on building an online platform that would make it quick and easy for startups to connect with a global network of angel investors. And so, Angel Investment Network was born.Fast forward a few years and we're now one of the the world's largest angel networks with over 1.5 million entrepreneurs and over 300,000 investors, and we’re growing daily.We've designed a user-friendly form for entrepreneurs to build their pitch and have loads of tips and guides to guide them through the whole process.Investors can browse the deals on our website and filter them by keyword, location, industry, investment level, etc. If they find one that interests them, they can connect with the entrepreneur and continue the discussions.In 2023 we launched our investor focused app.  The new app, which is free for investors, provides instant access to our global networks.  This will enable investors to grow their portfolios through exploring deals, connecting and investing with entrepreneurs on the move.   You can find us on the App store and Android. Join us on this exciting journey of innovation and growth. Together, let's shape the future of entrepreneurship and make a lasting impact.",

      companyOverview:"Welcome to US Angel Investment Network. We are James Badgett and Mike Lebus, founders of the platform.Back in 2004, we noticed a significant challenge in the startup scene. Many brilliant ideas were struggling to find the necessary seed funding to grow, and entrepreneurs were finding it difficult to connect with the right investors who could guide their growth.Driven by our passion for entrepreneurship, we set out on a mission to solve this problem. We embarked on building an online platform that would make it quick and easy for startups to connect with a global network of angel investors. And so, US Angel Investment Network was born.Like all founders we started small, but over time, our vision grew. Today, our network spans 40 networks across 90 different countries. We are proud to have 1,917,017 registered members, including 357,879 investors and 1,559,138 entrepreneurs. This remarkable growth has made us the largest angel investment community globally, and we continue to expand every day.",

      companyOverview:"Back in 2004, we noticed a significant challenge in the start-up scene. Many brilliant ideas were struggling to find the necessary seed funding to grow, and entrepreneurs were finding it difficult to connect with the right investors who could guide their growth. Driven by our passion for entrepreneurship, we set out on a mission to solve this problem. We embarked on building an online platform that would make it quick and easy for startups to connect with a global network of angel investors. And so, Angel Investment Network was born.Fast forward a few years and we're now one of the the world's largest angel networks with over 1.5 million entrepreneurs and over 300,000 investors, and we’re growing daily.We've designed a user-friendly form for entrepreneurs to build their pitch and have loads of tips and guides to guide them through the whole process. Investors can browse the deals on our website and filter them by keyword, location, industry, investment level, etc. If they find one that interests them, they can connect with the entrepreneur and continue the discussions.",

Leveraging this network, BigRentz can deliver equipment and services to over 90% of job sites in the U.S. within a 30 minute drive, and 98% within an hour. This is critical to contractors and service providers because nearly 40% of rental cost is tied to the transportation of equipment to and from job sites. Construction-related businesses spend about 35% of a typical week on non-optional activities such as procuring equipment, labor, and materials. With BigRentz, customers can expect to save 15-20% on rental management when including the all-in costs of transportation, time spent sourcing, and servicing issues.
