Leveraging this network, BigRentz can deliver equipment and services to over 90% of job sites in the U.S. within a 30 minute drive, and 98% within an hour. This is critical to contractors and service providers because nearly 40% of rental cost is tied to the transportation of equipment to and from job sites. Construction-related businesses spend about 35% of a typical week on non-optional activities such as procuring equipment, labor, and materials. With BigRentz, customers can expect to save 15-20% on rental management when including the all-in costs of transportation, time spent sourcing, and servicing issues.
